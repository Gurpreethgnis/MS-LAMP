MS-LAMP Linux Installer Guide

Mass Spectrometry based Lipid(ome) Analyzer and Molecular Platform (MS-LAMP) is a novel standalone software capable of aiding in interpreting electrospray ionization (ESI) and/or matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric data of lipids.
MS-LAMP has been built on Perl::Tk and hence the user must install Tk module that can be done using the following command before MS-LAMP can be made to work.

Command for installing Tk module from command prompt

"sudo apt-get install Tk"

This command will require authentication using administrative user password. 

Alternatively the Tk module can also be installed via CPAN using the following command via CPAN.

cpan> install Tk

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Once the Tk module has been installed, for making MS-LAMP work, three modifications need to be done to each .pl file.

1. Assigning the HOME directory.
 
$HOME="/home/user/MS-LAMP";

Provide the path for MS-LAMP within the double quotes. 
Provide the complete path of location of MS-LAMP omitting the last '/' as examplified above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Assigining the application for reading Pdf files.

$PDFCOMMAND="evince"; 

By default 'evince' Pdf reader has been assiged for reading the pdf files.
In case, the user has some other Pdf reader installed, the user needs to provide the command for that software replacing 'evince'.
In some cases the user may need to provide the complete path of the location of Pdf reader.
It is to be remembered that the user accesing the pdf reader must be provided the necessary permissions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Assigning the application to view structure.

$STRUCTURECOMMAND="pymol";

pymol is software used to view mol sructure files. 
By default 'pymol' has been assigned to view structure for General Lipidome MS-LAMP. 
The user may choose to install pymol for viewing .mol structures or may install some other software such as JMOL.
If software other than pymol is used then the user is required to provide the corresponding command in place of 'pymol'.

For the case of M.tb Lipidome MS-LAMP 'shotwell' has been assigned as software for viewing structures saved as image files.
In case, the user has some other picture manager, the user needs to provide the command for that software replacing 'shotwell'.

====================================================================================================================================

MS-LAMP can also generate xls files wherein the results are summarised using bar graphs and pie charts.
For configuring MS-LAMP to generate xls files, Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module from cpan needs to be installed.
For installing Spreadsheet::WriteExcel the following command may be used from the command prompt.

With ActiveState Perl, you can use

"ppm install Spreadsheet::WriteExcel"

With Strawberry Perl, you can use

"perl -MCPAN -e shell install Spreadsheet::WriteExcel"

Once Spreadsheet::WriteExcel has been installed the user needs to activate xls button by doing the following.

1.Open the .pl file
2.Search for #xls
3.delete #
4. Save the changes.

The pl file has been configured to generate xls output!!!
